=====
Ruby-LCD, a bunch of Ruby stuff for LCDProc (lcdproc.org)
http://seph.us/?z=code-ruby-lcd
(C) 2003 Ryan Joseph <j@seph.us>

=====
Requires

* Ruby (duh!)
* LCDProc 0.4.x (haven't really tested with many versions)

=====
Clients

All of the clients have been written for a 20x4 display and I currently have
no plans to make them more portable to different display sizes for two
reasons: 1) 20x4 known to be the best-supported display size for lcdproc and
2) I only have a 20x4 display and am too lazy to use the curses driver to
write for others.  If you want to send me a new LCD to test, feel free ;)

=====
Library

See README.library

=====
Install

$ su -c 'ruby install.rb'

=====
Removing

$ su -c 'ruby install.rb clean'

All of this stuff (and I mean all of it) is licensed under the GNU GPL

stupid, long preamble in every file, but I'm not going to sue you if you use
my code, steal if, molest it, have your way with it, anything.  Go right
ahead, seriously.
